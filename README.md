Tired of looking like an exhausted goblin before taking a selfie on Chatroulette? <br>
This extension allows you to use ANY image as your selfie. So go out, take a nice picture from your phone and upload it on Chatroulette!

<hr>

+ **Permissions explained**: <br>
  + *Storage:* This application may suggest that it needs access to your browser history. It does not. It actually uses LocalStorage which is a database for the website.
  + *Native Messaging:* Cooperating native applications means the extension talks to the website and back to update your selfie.

+ **Github**: <br>
The code's open source! Check it out on my github. https://github.com/SuppliedOrange/Chatroulette-Custom-Selfie/

+ **Note**: <br>
I do not suggest using NSFW images, impersonating people, hiding your face etc. I am not responsible if you get banned on Chatroulette for it. Please read Chatroulette's rules before using this.

+ **Dependencies:** <br>
  + Bootstrap 5.3 (bundled minified JS and CSS in /deps)
  + Animate.css (minified CSS in /deps)
