### Tired of looking like an exhausted goblin before taking a selfie on Chatroulette? <br>
### This extension allows you to use ANY image as your selfie. Maybe even use a moving gif! So go out, take a nice picture or video on your phone and upload it to Chatroulette!

<br>

+ **Usage:**

  + You will need to set a selfie before using this. Doesn't matter if it's bad. The extension just replaces that selfie.
 
  + If you're using a gif, make sure its very less in size. Preferably less than 5 MB. Reduce it's frames and compress it before uploading it. Everyone else can see your selfie move after that. **Make sure your face is visible.**

<br>

+ **Github**: <br>
The code's open source! Check it out on my [github](https://github.com/SuppliedOrange/Chatroulette-Custom-Selfie/)

<br>

+ **Note**: <br>
I do not suggest using NSFW images, impersonating people, hiding your face etc. I am not responsible if you get banned on Chatroulette for it. Please read Chatroulette's rules before using this.

<br>

+ **Dependencies:** <br>
  + Bootstrap 5.3 (bundled minified JS and CSS in /deps)
  + Animate.css (minified CSS in /deps)
