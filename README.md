### Tired of looking like an exhausted goblin before taking a selfie on Chatroulette? <br>
### This extension allows you to use ANY image as your selfie. So go out, take a nice picture on your phone and upload it on Chatroulette!

<hr> 

<br>

+ **Usage:**

  + You will need to set a selfie before using this. Doesn't matter if it's bad. The extension just replaces that selfie.

  + The extension also flips your thumbnail and resizes it. This is how others will actually see you. As a 1x1 non-inverted picture.

<br>

+ **Permissions explained**: <br>
  + *Storage:* This application may tell you that it needs access to your browser history. It does not. It actually uses LocalStorage which is a database for the website.
  + *Native Messaging:* Cooperating native applications means the extension talks to the website and back to update your selfie.

<br>

+ **Github**: <br>
The code's open source! Check it out on my [github](https://github.com/SuppliedOrange/Chatroulette-Custom-Selfie/)

<br>

+ **Note**: <br>
I do not suggest using NSFW images, impersonating people, hiding your face etc. I am not responsible if you get banned on Chatroulette for it. Please read Chatroulette's rules before using this.

<br>

+ **Dependencies:** <br>
  + Bootstrap 5.3 (bundled minified JS and CSS in /deps)
  + Animate.css (minified CSS in /deps)
